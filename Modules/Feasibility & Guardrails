Apply these **if/else** checks to make sure plans are realistic and adapt to edge cases:

1. **Closed Venue**
   
   - If a museum or park is closed on that day → suggest a similar indoor option nearby.

2. **Over-Budget Meal**
   
   - If meal cost > user’s budget → switch to a cheaper restaurant of similar cuisine.

3. **Too Far or Long Travel**
   
   - If transfer between activities > 25 min or > 5 km → pick a closer alternative or add a short transit hop.
